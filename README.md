# Deep Learning and  scrambling

This repository contains the code to generate the results of the paper  https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04621.

## Notebooks:



### 1. OTOC.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates how to calculate OTOC to reproduce Fig. 6.

### 2. LSTM.ipynb
This notebook shows  the training the LSTM neural network for the homogeneous model  where $\theta^i_p = \theta^j_p$. Using this notebook, figure 3 of the paper can be reproduced. 

### 2. CONVLSTM.ipynb
This notebook shows the training of the CONVLSTM neural network for the inhomogeneous model  where $\theta^i_p \neq \theta^j_p$. Using this notebook, figure 4 of the paper can be reproduced. 

## Python Modules:

### 1. Simulating_Dynamics_of_random_circuits.py
This module includes the code for simulating the dynamics of random circuits to generate data for training.
